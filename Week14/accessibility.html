    <p>Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) is an effort by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to make the web accessible to people with disabilities. The four tenets of web accessibility are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Perceivable: Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.</li>
      <li>Operable: User interface components and navigation must be operable.</li>
      <li>Understandable: Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable.</li>
      <li>Robust: Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Evaluation Methodology (WCAG-EM) provides guidance on evaluating web content for accessibility. It consists of four steps:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Plan: Define the scope of the evaluation and the resources required.</li>
      <li>Prepare: Gather information about the web content and identify accessibility requirements.</li>
      <li>Execute: Evaluate the web content and report on its level of conformance to accessibility requirements.</li>
      <li>Report: Document the evaluation process and results, and provide recommendations for improving accessibility.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Using semantic tags is important for web accessibility because it helps assistive technologies to interpret the content of web pages more accurately. Semantic tags provide meaning to the content, making it easier for people with disabilities to understand the structure and purpose of the page. Examples of semantic tags include <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>.</p>

    <p>The Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) specification provides a way to add accessibility information to web pages that may not be present in the HTML code. ARIA roles, states, and properties can be used to describe the behavior and purpose of user interface components to assistive technologies. This helps to make web pages more accessible to people with disabilities.</p>
